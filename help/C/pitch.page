    <title>Pitch</title>
    <p>Pitch shifting is a sound recording technique in which the original Pitch of a sound is raised or lowered. Easy Effects uses the pitch shifter from SoundTouch.</p>

                        <em style="strong">High Consistency</em> - Uses the method that gives greatest consistency when used to create small variations in pitch around the 1.0-ratio level. Unlike the previous two options, this avoids discontinuities when moving across the 1.0 pitch scale. It also consumes more CPU than the others in the case where the pitch scale is exactly 1.0. </p>

                    <p>
                        <em style="strong">Crisp</em> - Resets component phases at the peak of each transient (the start of a significant note or percussive event). This usually results in a clear-sounding output, but it is not always consistent, and may cause interruptions in stable sounds present at the same time as transient events. </p>

                    <p>
                        <em style="strong">Mixed</em> - Resets component phases at the peak of each transient, outside a frequency range typical of musical fundamental frequencies. The results may be more regular for mixed stable and percussive notes than Crisp option, but with a "phasier" sound. The balance may sound very good for certain types of music and fairly bad for others. </p>
