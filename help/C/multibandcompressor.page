    <title>Multiband Compressor</title>
    <p>Easy Effects uses the Sidechain Multiband Compressor Stereo developed by Linux Studio Plugins. Please refer to the <link xref="compressor" its:withinText="yes">Compressor</link> documentation to comprehend the basic functionality of the dynamic range compression.</p>

                </title>
                <p>This Compressor allows to split the input signal up to 8 bands. Each band is not attached to its strict frequency and can be controlled by completely different frequency range that can be obtained by applying Low-Cut and Hi-Cut filters to the Sidechain signal.</p>
                <p>The first band is always enabled while the others can be activated if needed. When only the first band is enabled, the functionality is similar to the Singleband Sidechain Compressor. Otherwise the signal is split in more bands and each band is compressed individually. After the compression stage, the bands are mixed together to form the output result.</p>

                </title>
                <p>If enabled, it introduces a special mode for assigning the same weight for higher frequencies opposite to lower frequencies.</p>
                <p>When disabled, the frequency band is processed 'as is', but the usual audio signal has 3 dB/octave falloff in the frequency domain and could be compared with the pink noise. So lower frequencies take more effect on the Compressor rather than higher frequencies.</p>
                <p>On the other hand the Sidechain Boost mode allows to compensate the -3 dB/octave falloff of the signal spectrum and, even more, makes the signal spectrum growing +3 dB/octave in the almost fully audible frequency range.</p>
                <p>
                    <em style="strong">Pink</em> applies +3 dB/octave while <em style="strong">Brown</em> applies +6 dB/octave Sidechain Boost. Each of them can use bilinear-transformed (BT) or matched-transformed (MT) shelving filter. </p>

                <p>If the Sidechain level is above that Threshold, the compressor uses the Release Time for the releasing stage. Otherwise the Attack Time is used in place of Release Time.</p>
                <p>For example, with -10 dB Attack Threshold and -60 dB Release Threshold, if the Sidechain is above <code its:withinText="nested">-10 + (-60) = -70 dB</code>, the Release Time is used for the gain restoration. If the Sidechain is below -70 dB, the Attack Time is used for the gain restoration.</p>

                <p>For example, when the Ratio is 2 in Downward mode and the Sidechain rises above the Threshold by 10 dB, the signal would be ideally reduced by 5 dB (10/2 dB). In practice this behavior mostly depends on how the Multiband Compressor is designed and configured.</p>
